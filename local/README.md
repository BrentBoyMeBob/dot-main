# Stowed Dotfiles
This includes everything else that respectfully has it's own configuration. This includes my Vim config, my Emacs config, my VSCode config, and much more.

# Install
Clone the GitHub repository to `~/.dotfiles`, a command for this is `git clone https://github.com/BrentBoyMeBob/dot-main ~/.dotfiles`. Add the local dotfiles with GNU Stow, using `cd ~/.dotfiles && stow ~/.dotfiles/local`.
