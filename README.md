# My Simple Dotfiles

This includes a couple of pieces of software that are being used, including:
- A clean and organized ZSH theme.
- A lean and catered Kitty config for my system.
- My small Vim config as a secondary editor alongside Emacs.
- Adapting to the Nord colorscheme.

My Emacs configuration is now located in [it's own repository](https://github.com/BrentBoyMeBob/bingus-emacs). Older dotfiles (including my Suckless forks and Nix configs) are stored in my own [dot-dump](https://github.com/BrentBoyMeBob/dot-dump) repository.

## Installation

To install my local dotfiles, just execute `install`, which will link all of the dotfiles using Dotbot. Keep in mind that you will have to imperatively install all of the software listed above, which can vary between distro.
