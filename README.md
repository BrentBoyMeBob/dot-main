# My Simple Dotfiles

This includes a couple of pieces of software that are being used, including:
- A clean and organized ZSH configuration and prompt.
- A VSCode configuration as well as my Vim configuration for small edits.
- Utilizing the brilliant GitHub Light and Dark Dimmed themes.

Older dotfiles that I don't use anymore are stored in the [dot-dump](https://github.com/BrentBoyMeBob/dot-dump) repository.

## Installation

To install my local dotfiles, just execute `install`, which will link all of the dotfiles using Dotbot. Keep in mind that you will have to imperatively install all of the software listed above, which can vary between distro.
