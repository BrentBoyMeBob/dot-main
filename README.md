# My Simple Dotfiles
This includes a couple of pieces of software that are being used, including:
- A quick and simple ZSH config with some helpful features, avoiding what I don't need.
- A lean and catered Kitty config for my system.
- My small Vim config as a secondary editor alongside Emacs.
- Adapting to the Tomorrow Night colorscheme.

Older dotfiles (including my Suckless forks and Nix configs) are stored in my own [dot-dump](https://github.com/BrentBoyMeBob/dot-dump) repository.

## Installation

To install my local dotfiles, just execute `install`, which will link all of the dotfiles using Dotbot. Keep in mind that you will have to imperatively install all of the software listed above, which can vary between distro.
