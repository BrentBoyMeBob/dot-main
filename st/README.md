# Brent's Simple Terminal
This fork of ST attempts to be a basic and simplistic terminal, whilst also adding unique features such as Boxdrawing and Ligatures.

## Installation
1. There are no extra dependencies; you just need the typical ST dependencies, which are also in the `xorg` and `base-devel` groups on Arch Linux.
2. (Skip if you've done the DWM instructions beforehand.) Clone the GitHub repository to anywhere you'd like, and enter the `st` directory.
3. Compile and install it using `make && sudo make install`, and once again, feel free to change `config.h` to your liking.
